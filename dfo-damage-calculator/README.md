# DFO Damage Calculator

The purpose of the DFO Damage Calculator project is to allow players of DFO to craft item sets and skill builds to theoretically determine various outcomes and statistics.  The most common calculation expected is how much damage a player's character can do before enemy defense is applied.  This, as well as most other statistics, are planned to have an accompanying visual breakdown of how all sources contribute.

The main contributor is Kajitii.  He is the original author, developer, and collaborator of this calculator project.  A big thanks go out to all the other contributors of knowledge and testing, both here and in-game:
* Feeshi
* IceWraith \(Overkill\)
* Lethologica
* YinYins \(YumeNight\)
* BlackFatalis
* DarkAlleyCat
* Coke \(GrabMeACoke\)

The existence of a DFO damage calculator in Chinese is known and acknowledged.  However, its description and utility are unknown.  No designs or concepts are knowingly borrowed from the Chinese version of the calculator.
